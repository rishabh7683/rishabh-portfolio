Introducing Khanik Bot, an advanced AI tool built with the help of Random Forest, a machine learning algorithm. This powerful tool focuses on optimizing Facebook Ads campaigns by analyzing various data sets such as age, gender, location, device, platform, time, and flexible inclusion/exclusion data. Khanik Bot begins by cleaning and processing the data, followed by feature engineering.

Once the data is prepared, it is fed into the Random Forest algorithm, which assigns weights to each feature. These weights determine the importance of each feature in driving campaign success. By identifying the most crucial features, marketers can allocate their resources effectively, investing more in the high-weighted features.
