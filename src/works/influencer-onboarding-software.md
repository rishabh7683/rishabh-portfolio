Introducing our Influencer Onboarding Software, a powerful in-house tool designed to streamline the process of onboarding creators for brand projects. With this internal software, we offer different roles, including admin, manager, and executive, to facilitate smooth collaboration.

Within the software, managers can create projects and request creators from the admin. The admin then assigns the requested creators to the managers, who can further distribute them among the designated executives for the campaign. This efficient workflow allows the team to seamlessly work on the entire campaign within the onboarding software itself.
